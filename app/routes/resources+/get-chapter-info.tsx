// 	'In this video, I wantto familiarize you with the idea of a limit, whichis a super important idea. It&amp;#39;s really the idea that allof calculus is based upon. But despite beingso super important, it&amp;#39;s actually a really, really,really, really, really, really simple idea. So let me draw afunction here, actually, let me define a function here,a kind of a simple function. So let&amp;#39;s define f of x,let&amp;#39;s say that f of x is going to be x minus1 over x minus 1. And you might say,hey, Sal look, I have the same thing in thenumerator and denominator. If I have somethingdivided by itself, that would just be equal to 1. Can&amp;#39;t I just simplifythis to f of x equals 1? And I would say, well,you&amp;#39;re almost true, the difference betweenf of x equals 1 and this thing right over here,is that this thing can never equal-- this thing isundefined when x is equal to 1. Because if you set,let me define it. Let me write it overhere, if you have f of, sorry not f of 0, if youhave f of 1, what happens. In the numerator,we get 1 minus 1, which is, let me just writeit down, in the numerator, you get 0. And in the denominator, youget 1 minus 1, which is also 0. And so anything divided by0, including 0 divided by 0, this is undefined. So you can makethe simplification. You can say that this is you thesame thing as f of x is equal to 1, but you would have to addthe constraint that x cannot be equal to 1. Now this and thisare equivalent, both of these aregoing to be equal to 1 for all other X&amp;#39;s otherthan one, but at x equals 1, it becomes undefined. This is undefined andthis one&amp;#39;s undefined. So how would Igraph this function. So let me graph it. So that, is my y isequal to f of x axis, y is equal to f of x axis,and then this over here is my x-axis. And then let&amp;#39;s say this isthe point x is equal to 1. This over here would bex is equal to negative 1. This is y is equal to 1, rightup there I could do negative 1. but that matter much relative tothis function right over here. And let me graph it. So it&amp;#39;s essentially forany x other than 1 f of x is going to be equal to 1. So it&amp;#39;s going tobe, look like this. It&amp;#39;s going to looklike this, except at 1. At 1 f of x is undefined. So I&amp;#39;m going to put alittle bit of a gap right over here, the circle to signifythat this function is not defined. We don&amp;#39;t know what thisfunction equals at 1. We never defined it. This definition of thefunction doesn&amp;#39;t tell us what to do with 1. It&amp;#39;s literally undefined,literally undefined when x is equal to 1. So this is the functionright over here. And so once again, if someonewere to ask you what is f of 1, you go, and let&amp;#39;s say thateven though this was a function definition, you&amp;#39;d go,OK x is equal to 1, oh wait there&amp;#39;s a gap inmy function over here. It is undefined. So let me write it again. It&amp;#39;s kind of redundant, but I&amp;#39;llrewrite it f of 1 is undefined. But what if I wereto ask you, what is the functionapproaching as x equals 1. And now this is starting totouch on the idea of a limit. So as x gets closerand closer to 1. So as we get closerand closer x is to 1, what is thefunction approaching. Well, this entiretime, the function, what&amp;#39;s a gettingcloser and closer to. On the left hand side,no matter how close you get to 1, as longas you&amp;#39;re not at 1, you&amp;#39;re actually at fof x is equal to 1. Over here from the right handside, you get the same thing. So you could say, andwe&amp;#39;ll get more and more familiar with this ideaas we do more examples, that the limit as x andL-I-M, short for limit, as x approaches 1 of f of xis equal to, as we get closer, we can get unbelievably, wecan get infinitely close to 1, as long as we&amp;#39;re not at 1. And our function isgoing to be equal to 1, it&amp;#39;s getting closer andcloser and closer to 1. It&amp;#39;s actually at1 the entire time. So in this case, wecould say the limit as x approaches1 of f of x is 1. So once again, it has very fancynotation, but it&amp;#39;s just saying, look what is afunction approaching as x gets closerand closer to 1. Let me do another example wherewe&amp;#39;re dealing with a curve, just so that you havethe general idea. So let&amp;#39;s say thatI have the function f of x, let me just forthe sake of variety, let me call it g of x. Let&amp;#39;s say that we haveg of x is equal to, I could define it this way, wecould define it as x squared, when x does not equal, I don&amp;#39;tknow when x does not equal 2. And let&amp;#39;s say that when xequals 2 it is equal to 1. So once again, a kindof an interesting function that, as you&amp;#39;llsee, is not fully continuous, it has a discontinuity. Let me graph it. So this is my yequals f of x axis, this is my x-axisright over here. Let me draw x equals 2, x,let&amp;#39;s say this is x equals 1, this is x equals 2, this isnegative 1, this is negative 2. And then let me draw, soeverywhere except x equals 2, it&amp;#39;s equal to x squared. So let me draw it like this. So it&amp;#39;s going to be a parabola,looks something like this, let me draw a betterversion of the parabola. So it&amp;#39;ll looksomething like this. Not the most beautifullydrawn parabola in the history ofdrawing parabolas, but I think it&amp;#39;llgive you the idea. I think you know what aparabola looks like, hopefully. It should be symmetric,let me redraw it because that&amp;#39;s kind of ugly. And that&amp;#39;s looking better. OK, all right, there you go. All right, now, this would bethe graph of just x squared. But this can&amp;#39;t be. It&amp;#39;s not x squaredwhen x is equal to 2. So once again, whenx is equal to 2, we should have a little bitof a discontinuity here. So I&amp;#39;ll draw a gap right overthere, because when x equals 2 the function is equal to 1. When x is equal to2, so let&amp;#39;s say that, and I&amp;#39;m not doing them on thesame scale, but let&amp;#39;s say that. So this, on the graph of fof x is equal to x squared, this would be 4, this wouldbe 2, this would be 1, this would be 3. So when x is equal to 2,our function is equal to 1. So this is a bit ofa bizarre function, but we can define it this way. You can define a functionhowever you like to define it. And so notice, it&amp;#39;sjust like the graph of f of x is equal to x squared,except when you get to 2, it has this gap,because you don&amp;#39;t use the f of x is equal to xsquared when x is equal to 2. You use f of x--or I should say g of x-- you use gof x is equal to 1. Have I been saying f of x? I apologize for that. You use g of x is equal to 1. So then then at 2, justat 2, just exactly at 2, it drops down to 1. And then it keeps goingalong the function g of x is equal to, or Ishould say, along the function x squared. So my question to you. So there&amp;#39;s a coupleof things, if I were to just evaluatethe function g of 2. Well, you&amp;#39;d lookat this definition, OK, when x equals 2, I usethis situation right over here. And it tells me, it&amp;#39;sgoing to be equal to 1. Let me ask a moreinteresting question. Or perhaps a moreinteresting question. What is the limit as xapproaches 2 of g of x. Once again, fancy notation,but it&amp;#39;s asking something pretty, pretty, pretty simple. It&amp;#39;s saying as x gets closer andcloser to 2, as you get closer and closer, and this isn&amp;#39;ta rigorous definition, we&amp;#39;ll do that in future videos. As x gets closer and closer to2, what is g of x approaching? So if you get to 1.9, andthen 1.999, and then 1.999999, and then 1.9999999, whatis g of x approaching. Or if you were to go fromthe positive direction. If you were to say2.1, what&amp;#39;s g of 2.1, what&amp;#39;s g of 2.01, what&amp;#39;s g of2.001, what is that approaching as we get closerand closer to it. And you can see it visuallyjust by drawing the graph. As g gets closerand closer to 2, and if we were tofollow along the graph, we see that weare approaching 4. Even though that&amp;#39;s notwhere the function is, the function drops down to 1. The limit of g of x as xapproaches 2 is equal to 4. And you could even do thisnumerically using a calculator, and let me do that, because Ithink that will be interesting. So let me get thecalculator out, let me get my trusty TI-85 out. So here is my calculator,and you could numerically say, OK, what&amp;#39;s itgoing to approach as you approach x equals 2. So let&amp;#39;s try 1.94,for x is equal to 1.9, you would use this topclause right over here. So you&amp;#39;d have 1.9 squared. And so you get 3.61, well whatif you get even closer to 2, so 1.99, and once again,let me square that. Well now I&amp;#39;m at 3.96. What if I do 1.999,and I square that? I&amp;#39;m going to have 3.996. Notice I&amp;#39;m goingcloser, and closer, and closer to our point. And if I did, if Igot really close, 1.9999999999 squared,what am I going to get to. It&amp;#39;s not actuallygoing to be exactly 4, this calculator justrounded things up, but going to get to a numberreally, really, really, really, really, really, really,really, really close to 4. And we can do something fromthe positive direction too. And it actually hasto be the same number when we approach from the belowwhat we&amp;#39;re trying to approach, and above what we&amp;#39;retrying to approach. So if we try to 2.1squared, we get 4.4. If we do 2. let me go a coupleof steps ahead, 2.01, so this is muchcloser to 2 now, squared. Now we are gettingmuch closer to 4. So the closer weget to 2, the closer it seems likewe&amp;#39;re getting to 4. So once again,that&amp;#39;s a numeric way of saying that thelimit, as x approaches 2 from either direction of gof x, even though right at 2, the function is equal to 1,because it&amp;#39;s discontinuous. The limit as we&amp;#39;reapproaching 2, we&amp;#39;re getting closer, andcloser, and closer to 4.',
// 	'how can we prove that a function is continuous at a certain point how can we do so there&amp;#39;s something called the three-step continuity test and the first step is that you have to show that the function is defined at some point a so f of a has to exist it has to equal a certain value the second step is to show that the limit as x approaches a of f of x exists now how do we do that how do we show that this limit exists well you need to show that the left-sided limit the limit as x approaches a from the left side is indeed equal to the limit as x approaches a from the right side only under those conditions will the limit exist now the third step is to show that the limit as x approaches a from either side of f x is indeed equal to f of a so that&amp;#39;s the three-step continuity test so let&amp;#39;s go ahead and apply it with a certain example so let&amp;#39;s say that the function f of x is equal to the square root of x plus two when x is less than two and it&amp;#39;s equal to x squared minus two when x is between two and three and it&amp;#39;s equal to two x plus let&amp;#39;s say five when x is equal to or greater than three so go ahead and prove that the function is continuous or discontinuous at two and three so let&amp;#39;s start with an x value of two so therefore we need to use these two functions so what is f of 2 to find f of 2 we need to use the second function because x is greater than or equal to two so that&amp;#39;s going to be two squared minus two which is four minus two so that&amp;#39;s equal to two so f of a is defined that&amp;#39;s step one step two we need to show that the limit exists so first we need to find the value of the limit as x approaches 2 from the left side of f of x so on the left side of 2 that&amp;#39;s when x is less than 2. so we got to use this function and so that&amp;#39;s going to be the square root of 2 plus 2 which is the square root of 4 and that&amp;#39;s equal to 2. so now we got to check the right side the limit as x approaches 2 from the right on the right side x is greater than 2 so we&amp;#39;re going to use this function x squared minus 2 so that&amp;#39;s 2 squared minus 2 which we know is 2. now because the left side and the right side are the same that means that the limit indeed exists so we can say that the limit as x approaches two from either side of f of x is equal to two now notice that these two are the same so now we can make the statement for step three that the limit as x approaches a or two of f of x is indeed equal to f of two because they both equal two so therefore the function is continuous at x equals two now let&amp;#39;s move on to the next example and that is at an x value of three so we need to use these two functions so first let&amp;#39;s determine if it&amp;#39;s defined at three so f of three x is equal to three in the third part of the function so it&amp;#39;s gonna be two times three plus five two times three is six six plus five is eleven now let&amp;#39;s move on to step two let&amp;#39;s find the limit as x approaches three from the left side so therefore we need to use this function three from the left is going to be less than three so it&amp;#39;s three squared minus two three squared is nine nine minus two is seven now let&amp;#39;s find as x approaches 3 from the right so we have to use this expression so it&amp;#39;s going to be 2 times 3 plus 5 which is 6 plus 5 that&amp;#39;s 11. now notice that the left side and the right side of the limit doesn&amp;#39;t match so therefore the limit as x approaches 3 of f of x does not exist and if the limit does not exist it is not continuous at x equals 3. so therefore you could say it is discontinuous at x equal stream now because these two points do not match and we don&amp;#39;t have a rational function this type of discontinuity is known as a jump discontinuity now let&amp;#39;s work on some more examples here&amp;#39;s another problem that you could try let&amp;#39;s say that f of x is equal to 2x plus five when x is less than negative one and it&amp;#39;s equal to x squared plus two when x is greater than negative one and then it&amp;#39;s equal to five when x is equal to one rather negative one so there&amp;#39;s only one x value that we need to be concerned about and that x value is negative one so go ahead and determine if it&amp;#39;s continuous or discontinuous at negative one and if it&amp;#39;s discontinuous determine the type of discontinuity use the three-step continuity test to do so so first we need to determine if the function is defined at negative one so what is the value of f of negative one when x is exactly negative one what is y notice that y is five when x is negative one so f of negative one is five so therefore f of a is defined so we finished with step one now step two we need to prove that the limit exists so let&amp;#39;s find the limit as x approaches negative one from the left side so from the left side x has to be less than one i mean less than negative one so this is going to be two times negative one plus five we need to use this function so that&amp;#39;s negative two plus five which is equal to three now let&amp;#39;s find the limit as x approaches negative one from the right side so on the right of negative one we need to use x squared plus two because x is greater than negative one so that&amp;#39;s going to be negative one squared plus two which is one plus two that&amp;#39;s positive three now because these two are the same the limit exists so the limit as x approaches negative one of f of x from either side is indeed equal to three so we&amp;#39;re finished with step two now let&amp;#39;s focus on step three does the limit as x approaches negative one of f of x does it equal f of a notice that these two do not match they&amp;#39;re not the same so in step three we can make the statement that the limit as x approaches negative one of f of x does not equal f of negative one so therefore step three has failed which means that it is discontinuous at negative one but the limit exists so what type of discontinuity do we have in this case if the limit exists we have this situation we have a whole but the function is not defined at the whole the limit has a y value of three but the function has a y value of five so what we have is a hole basically a removable discontinuity in the last example the jump discontinuity was a non-removable discontinuity so if step two fails if these two values are different typically it&amp;#39;s the jump discontinuity if those two values are the same and if step three fails then usually it&amp;#39;s going to be a whole the only time you get an infinite discontinuity is if these values equal infinity so if you don&amp;#39;t have an infinity value it&amp;#39;s not going to be an infinite discontinuity you',
// 	'Welcome to the presentationon derivatives. I think you&amp;#39;re going to findthat this is when math starts to become a lot more fun thanit was just a few topics ago. Well let&amp;#39;s get startedwith our derivatives. I know it soundsvery complicated. Well, in general, if I have astraight line-- let me see if I can draw a straight lineproperly-- if I had a straight line-- that&amp;#39;s my coordinateaxes, which aren&amp;#39;t straight-- this is a straight line. But when I have a straight linelike that, and I ask you to find the slope-- I think youalready know how to do this-- it&amp;#39;s just the change in ydivided by the change in x. If I wanted to find the slope--really I mean the slope is the same, because it is a straightline, the slope is the same across the whole line, but if Iwant to find the slope at any point in this line, what Iwould do is I would pick a point x-- say I&amp;#39;dpick this point. We&amp;#39;d pick a different color--I&amp;#39;d take this point, I&amp;#39;d pick this point-- it&amp;#39;s prettyarbitrary, I could pick any two points, and I would figure outwhat the change in y is-- this is the change in y, delta y,that&amp;#39;s just another way of saying change in y-- andthis is the change in x. delta x. And we figured out that theslope is defined really as change in y dividedby change in x. And another way of saying thatis delta-- it&amp;#39;s that triangle-- delta y divided by delta x. Very straightforward. Now what happens, though,if we&amp;#39;re not dealing with a straight line? Let me see if I havespace to draw that. Another coordinate axes. Still pretty messy, but Ithink you&amp;#39;ll get the point. Now let&amp;#39;s say, instead of justa regular line like this, this follows the standardy equals mx plus b. Let&amp;#39;s just say I had thecurve y equals x squared. Let me draw it in adifferent color. So y equals x squared lookssomething like this. It&amp;#39;s a curve, you&amp;#39;re probablypretty familiar with it by now. And what I&amp;#39;m going toask you is, what is the slope of this curve? And think about that. What does it mean to takethe slope of a curve now? Well, in this line, the slopewas the same throughout the whole line. But if you look at thiscurve, doesn&amp;#39;t the slope change, right? Here it&amp;#39;s almost flat, and itgets steeper steeper steeper steeper steeper untilgets pretty steep. And if you go really far out,it gets extremely steep. So you&amp;#39;re probably saying,well, how do you figure out the slope of a curve whoseslope keeps changing? Well there is no slopefor the entire curve. For a line, there is a slopefor the entire line, because the slope never changes. But what we could try todo is figure out what the slope is at a given point. And the slope at a given pointwould be the same as the slope of a tangent line. For example-- let me pick agreen-- the slope at this point right here would be the sameas the slope of this line. Right? Because this lineis tangent to it. So it just touches that curve,and at that exact point, they would have-- this blue curve, yequals x squared, would have the same slope asthis green line. But if we go to a point backhere, even though this is a really badly drawn graph,the slope would be something like this. The tangent slope. The slope would be a negativeslope, and here it&amp;#39;s a positive slope, but if we took apoint here, the slope would be even more positive. So how are we goingto figure this out? How are we going to figure outwhat the slope is at any point along the curve yequals x squared? That&amp;#39;s where the derivativecomes into use, and now for the first time you&amp;#39;ll actually seewhy a limit is actually a useful concept. So let me try toredraw the curve. OK, I&amp;#39;ll draw my axes, that&amp;#39;sthe y-axis-- I&amp;#39;ll just do it in the first quadrant-- and thisis-- I really have to find a better tool to do my-- this isx coordinate, and then let me draw my curve in yellow. So y equals x squared lookssomething like this. I&amp;#39;m really concentratingto draw this at least decently good. OK. So let&amp;#39;s say we want to findthe slope at this point. Let&amp;#39;s call this point a. At this point, x equals a. And of course this is f of a. So what we could try to dois, we could try to find the slope of a secant line. A line between-- we takeanother point, say, somewhat close, to this point on thegraph, let&amp;#39;s say here, and if we could figure out the slopeof this line, it would be a bit of an approximation ofthe slope of the curve exactly at this point. So let me drawthat secant line. Something like that. Secant line lookssomething like that. And let&amp;#39;s say that this pointright here is a plus h, where this distance is just h, thisis a plus h, we&amp;#39;re just going h away from a, and thenthis point right here is f of a plus h. My pen is malfunctioning. So this would be anapproximation for what the slope is at this point. And the closer that h gets,the closer this point gets to this point, the better ourapproximation is going to be, all the way to the point thatif we could actually get the slope where h equals 0, thatwould actually be the slope, the instantaneous slope, atthat point in the curve. But how can we figure out whatthe slope is when h equals 0? So right now, we&amp;#39;re saying thatthe slope between these two points, it would be thechange in y, so what&amp;#39;s the change in y? It&amp;#39;s this, so that this pointright here is-- the x coordinate is-- my thing justkeeps messing up-- the x coordinate is a plus h, and they coordinate is f of a plus h. And this point right here, thecoordinate is a and f of a. So if we just use the standardslope formula, like before, we would say change iny over change in x. Well, what&amp;#39;s the change in y? It&amp;#39;s f of a plus h-- thisy coordinate minus this y coordinate-- minus f ofa over the change in x. Well that change in x is thisx coordinate, a plus h, minus this x coordinate, minus a. And of course this aand this a cancel out. So it&amp;#39;s f of a plus h,minus f of a, all over h. This is just the slopeof this secant line. And if we want to get the slopeof the tangent line, we would just have to find what happensas h gets smaller and smaller and smaller. And I think you knowwhere I&amp;#39;m going. Really, we just want to, if wewant to find the slope of this tangent line, we just haveto find the limit of this value as h approaches 0. And then, as h approaches 0,this secant line is going to get closer and closer to theslope of the tangent line. And then we&amp;#39;ll know the exactslope at the instantaneous point along the curve. And actually, it turns outthat this is the definition of the derivative. And the derivative is nothingmore than the slope of a curve at an exact point. And this is super useful,because for the first time, everything we&amp;#39;ve talkedabout to this point is the slope of a line. But now we can take anycontinuous curve, or most continuous curves, and findthe slope of that curve at an exact point. So now that I&amp;#39;ve given you thedefinition of what a derivative is, and maybe hopefully alittle bit of intuition, in the next presentation I&amp;#39;m going touse this definition to actually apply it to some functions,like x squared and others, and give you some more problems. I&amp;#39;ll see you in thenext presentation',
// 	'in this video we&amp;#39;re going to go over some differentiation formulas particularly if you&amp;#39;re studying derivatives in calculus so if you have a sheet of paper with you feel free to get ready to take down some notes so the first thing you want to be familiar with is the derivative of a constant the derivative of a constant is always a zero the next Formula you need to know is the power rule or the derivative of a power function here we have a variable raised to a constant it&amp;#39;s going to be that constant times the variable raised to the N minus 1. so for instance the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared the derivative of x to the fourth is 4X cubed the derivative of x to the fifth is five x to the fourth so that&amp;#39;s how you can employ the power rule to find the derivatives of functions like this now instead of having a variable raised to a constant what if we have a constant raised to a variable the derivative of a to the x is going to be a to the x times Ln a now the reason why we get that is because the derivative of x is one but let&amp;#39;s say we have the derivative of a to the U where a is a constant but U is a function of x this is going to be a to the U times the derivative of U times Ln a here we would have the derivative of x but that&amp;#39;s just going to be 1. now if you ever get this the derivative of a variable raised to a variable this rather than having a formula you need to employ a process called logarithmic differentiation and I have a video on YouTube that covers that so if you go to the YouTube search bar and type in logarithmic differentiation organic chemistry tutor you should see a video that will come up and explain how to do problems like this next up we have something called the constant multiple rule so if you have if you&amp;#39;re trying to find the derivative of a function multiplied by some constant C it&amp;#39;s simply going to be that constant times the derivative of that function so for instance let&amp;#39;s say if we want to find the derivative of 5x to the 4. we know the derivative of x to the 4 but we can rewrite this as 5. times the derivative of x to the fourth and using the power rule we know this is going to be 5 times 4X cubed which becomes 20x cubed the next Formula you need to be familiar with is the power rule so if we have two functions u and v and they&amp;#39;re multiplied to each other the derivative of the product of these two functions is going to be U Prime V plus UV Prime so it&amp;#39;s the derivative of U times V plus u times the derivative of V next up we have the quotient rule so here we have a fraction of two functions or a division of two functions and it&amp;#39;s going to be v u Prime minus u v Prime over V squared so that&amp;#39;s the formula associated with the quotient rule now sometimes you may need to find the derivative of a composite function in this case you need to use a chain rule so let&amp;#39;s say we have f of G of U we want to find the derivative of that so first we&amp;#39;re going to find the derivative of the outer function f we&amp;#39;re going to keep the inside part the same and then we&amp;#39;re going to multiply by the derivative of the inside part that is the derivative of G and then we&amp;#39;ll multiply by the derivative of the inside of G which is U so that will be times U Prime now you might see the chain rule represented as a function of X instead of U so let&amp;#39;s say if you have this F of G of x it&amp;#39;s going to be the derivative of the outside function we&amp;#39;ll keep the inside part the same and then times the derivative of the inside function now the derivative of x is one so there&amp;#39;s no point writing that it would just be times one so if you have X this is all you need but if you have a function U or a function like where use a function of X you&amp;#39;re also going to have U Prime at the end so keep that in mind so you got to differentiate the outer function f and then work your way towards the middle then G and then U now for those of you who want additional example problems on this check out the links in the description section below now let&amp;#39;s continue let&amp;#39;s talk about another form of the chain rule when it&amp;#39;s combined with the power rule so let&amp;#39;s say we want to find the derivative of the function f of x but it&amp;#39;s raised to the n so first we&amp;#39;re going to focus on the outside part we&amp;#39;re going to keep the inside part the same so it&amp;#39;s going to be n times f of x to the N raised to the N minus 1. much like the power rule where was n X raised to the N minus 1. but we do have a function on the inside it&amp;#39;s not just X it&amp;#39;s a function of X so now we&amp;#39;ve got to find the derivative of the inside so we&amp;#39;re going to multiply it by the derivative of the inside so this combines the power rule with a chain rule another formula that&amp;#39;s associated with the chain rule is this one d y d x is equal to d y d u times d u over DX now let&amp;#39;s talk about the derivative of logarithmic functions so let&amp;#39;s say we want to find the derivative of log base a of U where U is a function of x it&amp;#39;s going to be U Prime over U LNA if we want to find the derivative of the natural log of U keep in mind the base of a natural log of E it&amp;#39;s going to be U Prime over U it&amp;#39;s the same as this one the only issue is Ln e is equal to one so you could write it as just U on the bottom so those are the two formulas you need to be familiar with when finding the derivatives of logarithmic functions now let&amp;#39;s focus on trig functions the derivative of sine of U is going to be cosine U times U Prime now if you just have sine X the derivative of sine X is simply cosine X you could think of it as cosine X and the derivative of x is one so it&amp;#39;s just cosine X but let&amp;#39;s say if you was x squared if you want to find the derivative of sine X Squared it&amp;#39;s going to be cosine x squared and then times the derivative of x squared which would be 2X so this is the U part and this is the U Prime part that&amp;#39;s why I like to write it in this format it reminds you that you&amp;#39;ll need to employ the chain rule if you have something other than x as the angle now the derivative of cosine U this is going to be negative sine U times U Prime the derivative of tangent of U is secant squared times U Prime now for cotangent it&amp;#39;s going to be negative cosecant squared and as always times U Prime now the next two that you need to know are the derivative of secant and the derivative of secant&amp;#39;s cousin or cosecant and they&amp;#39;re quite similar if there&amp;#39;s a c in front typically it&amp;#39;s going to have a negative sign the derivative of secant is you know what let&amp;#39;s change this let&amp;#39;s change it from X to a u the derivative of secant U is going to be secant U tangent U times U Prime the derivative of cosecant use negative cosecant U cotangent U times U Prime now the next set of formos need to be familiar with are the inverse trig formulas so let&amp;#39;s start with the derivative of the inverse of sine of U so that&amp;#39;s U Prime over the square root of 1 minus U squared now just for comparison purposes if you have the inverse sine of x it&amp;#39;s going to be 1 over the square root of 1 minus x squared because the derivative of x is one you&amp;#39;re going to have that there but if you have U you can have U Prime instead of one so make sure you&amp;#39;re mindful of that difference now the derivative for the inverse cosine of U is going to be very similar to the derivative of sine the only difference is it&amp;#39;s going to have a negative sign but everything else is going to be the same now let&amp;#39;s move to the arc tangent function so the derivative of inverse tan of U it&amp;#39;s going to be U Prime over 1 plus u squared now for Arc cotangent it&amp;#39;s going to be negative U Prime over 1 plus u squared next up we have inverse secant and the formula for that is going to be U Prime over U square root U squared minus 1. and for inverse cosecant it&amp;#39;s negative U Prime over U square root U squared minus 1. so those are the formulas for the derivatives of the inverse trig functions so that&amp;#39;s it for this video so if you&amp;#39;re studying for a derivatives test at least you know the most common formula is that you&amp;#39;ll need and that you can be tested on so hopefully you wrote those down and thanks for watching',
// 	'what we&amp;#39;re going to go over in this video is one of the core principles in calculus and you&amp;#39;re going to use it any time you take the derivative of anything even reasonably complex and it&amp;#39;s called the chain rule and when you&amp;#39;re first exposed to it it can seem a little daunting and a little bit convoluted but as you see more and more examples it&amp;#39;ll start to make sense and hopefully it&amp;#39;ll even start to seem a little bit simple and intuitive over time so let&amp;#39;s say that i had a function let&amp;#39;s say i have a function h of x and it is equal to just for example i let&amp;#39;s say it&amp;#39;s equal to sine of x let&amp;#39;s say it&amp;#39;s equal to sine of x squared now i could have written that i could have written it like this sine squared of x but it&amp;#39;ll be a little bit clearer using using that type of notation so let me make it so i have h of x and what i&amp;#39;m curious about is what is h prime of x so i want to know h prime of x which another way of writing it is the derivative of h with respect to x these are just different notations and to do this i&amp;#39;m going to use the chain rule i am going to use the chain rule the chain rule comes into play every time any time your function can be used as a composition of more than one function and as that might not seem obvious right now but it will hopefully maybe by the end of this video or the next one now what i want to do is a little bit of a thought experiment a little bit of a thought experiment if i were to ask you what is the derivative with respect to x if i were to supply the derivative operator to x squared with respect to x what do i get well this gives me 2x we&amp;#39;ve seen that many many many many times now what if i were to take the derivative with respect to a of a squared well it&amp;#39;s the exact same thing i just swapped an a for the x&amp;#39;s this is still going to be equal to 2a now i will do something that might be a little bit more bizarre what if i were to take the derivative with respect to sine of x with respect to sine of x of of sine of x sine of x squared well wherever i had the x&amp;#39;s up here or the a&amp;#39;s over here i just replace it with a sine of x so this is just going to be 2 times the thing that i had so whatever i&amp;#39;m taking the derivative with respect to here with respect to x here with respect to a here&amp;#39;s with respect to sine of x so it&amp;#39;s going to be 2 times sine of x now so the chain rule tells us that this derivative is going to be the derivative of our whole function with respect or the derivative of this outer function x squared the derivative of x squared the derivative of this outer function with respect to sine of x so that&amp;#39;s going to be 2 sine of x 2 sine of x so we could view it as the derivative of the outer function with respect to the inner 2 sine of x we could just treat sine of x like it&amp;#39;s kind of an x and it would have been just 2x but instead it&amp;#39;s a sine of x so we say 2 sine of x times times the derivative we do this in green times the derivative of sine of x with respect to x times the derivative of sine of x with respect to x well that&amp;#39;s more straightforward a little bit more intuitive the derivative of sine of x with respect to x we&amp;#39;ve seen multiple times is cosine of x so times cosine of x and so there we&amp;#39;ve applied the chain rule it was the derivative of the outer function with respect to the inner so derivative of sine of x squared with respect to sine of x is 2 sine of x and then we multiply that times the derivative of sine of x with respect to x so let me make it clear this right over here is the derivative we&amp;#39;re taking the derivative of we&amp;#39;re taking the derivative of sine of x squared so let me make it clear that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re taking the derivative of with respect to sine of x with respect to sine of x and then we&amp;#39;re multiplying that times the derivative of sine of x the derivative of sine of x with respect to with respect to x and this is where it start might start making a little bit of intuition you can&amp;#39;t really treat these differentials this d whatever this dx this d sine of x as as a as a as a number and you really can&amp;#39;t this notation makes it look like a fraction because intuitively that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re doing but if you were to treat them like fractions then you could think about canceling that and that and once again this isn&amp;#39;t a rigorous thing to do but it can help with the intuition and then what you&amp;#39;re left with is the derivative of this whole sine of x squared with respect to x so you&amp;#39;re left with you&amp;#39;re left with the derivative of essentially our original function sine of x squared with respect to x with respect to x which is exactly what dhdx is this right over here this right over here is our original function h that&amp;#39;s our original function h so it might seem a little bit daunting now what i&amp;#39;ll do in the next video is another several examples and then we&amp;#39;ll try to abstract that this a little bit',
// 	'in this video we&amp;#39;re going to talk about how to do implicit differentiation so let&amp;#39;s say if you have this function x cubed plus let&amp;#39;s say y cubed is equal to 8 and you want to find d y d x at let&amp;#39;s say you want to just find d y d x so what we need to do is differentiate both sides with respect to x so that&amp;#39;s d over dx the derivative of x to the third is 3x squared and the derivative of y to the third is 3y squared times dydx for these kinds of problems anytime you differentiate a y value add dydx to it the derivative of a constant like eight is zero so now we gotta put d y d x we gotta get it by itself so if we move the three x squared to the other side here&amp;#39;s what we now have all we got to do now is divide both sides by 3y squared and so in this particular case dydx is therefore equal to the 3&amp;#39;s cancel it&amp;#39;s negative x squared over y squared so that&amp;#39;s how you can do it but now let&amp;#39;s try um another example so let&amp;#39;s say if we have this function x squared plus 2xy plus y squared equals 5. and we want to find dydx so let&amp;#39;s go ahead and jump right into it let&amp;#39;s differentiate x squared the derivative of x squared is 2x now for this part right here we have x and y combined and whenever you see that you need to use the product rule so let&amp;#39;s separate this function into two parts 2x and times y so to use the product rule the gist of it is like this you differentiate one part and then keep the other part the same so we&amp;#39;re going to differentiate the 2x part which is going to become 2 we&amp;#39;re going to keep y the same plus we need to keep the first part the same now and then differentiate the second part the derivative of y is one and any time you differentiate a y variable in relation to implicit differentiation add dydx to it so here we have y squared next and the derivative of y squared is 2y times d y dx and the derivative of any constant is always zero so now our goal right now is to isolate d y d x so any variable that or any term that doesn&amp;#39;t have a d y d x we&amp;#39;re gonna move it to the right side so what we now have on the left is 2 x d y d x plus 2 y d y d x is equal to negative 2 x minus 2 y there&amp;#39;s a lot of twos here you know what let&amp;#39;s divide everything by two so this will disappear that and that all of them will disappear our next step we&amp;#39;re going to factor out d y d x so we&amp;#39;re left with x plus y is equal to negative x minus y which we&amp;#39;re going to factor out negative one and that&amp;#39;s x plus y so now we&amp;#39;re going to divide both sides by x plus y so notice that the x plus y cancel so for this particular problem d y d x is just equal to negative one let&amp;#39;s try another problem for the sake of practice so let&amp;#39;s say if you have five x y minus y to the third is equal to eight now feel free to pause the video give this problem a shot and find d y d x so let&amp;#39;s use the product rule here so the first part is going to be 5x the second part is y the derivative of 5x is simply 5 and then times the second part y and bring it now we&amp;#39;re going to keep the first part the same 5x and then we&amp;#39;re going to differentiate y which is 1 times d y dx the derivative of y to the third is 3y squared d y dx and the derivative of a constant is zero so any term that doesn&amp;#39;t have a d y d x let&amp;#39;s move it to the other side so that&amp;#39;s the 5 y we&amp;#39;re gonna move it over here so now we have 5 x d y d x minus three y squared d y d x is equal to negative five y whenever you move a term from one side to another it changes from positive to negative or vice versa our next step is to factor out the gcf well not really the gcf but just dy dx we need to isolate it so we have d y d x times 5 x minus 3y squared equals negative 5y so our last step is to get dydx by itself by dividing both sides by 5x minus 3y squared and so now we have our answer dydx is equal to negative 5y over 5x minus 3y squared so that&amp;#39;s it for that problem but there&amp;#39;s more to talk about so let&amp;#39;s say if you have this problem let&amp;#39;s say tangent x y is equal to seven go ahead and find dydx for this problem the derivative of tangent is secant squared and we got to keep the inside the same the angle for tangent was x y so therefore the angle for secant squared has to be x y but now we got to differentiate the inside part according to the rules of the chain rule so let&amp;#39;s use the product rule the derivative of x is one keep the second part the same the derivative of y is one times d y d x but we got to keep the first part the same which is the x and the derivative of a constant is zero now for this problem to get d y d x by itself the first thing we need to do is distribute this term secant squared to y and to x d y d x so secant squared times y is simply y secant squared x y and for the next term this times secant squared is just x d y d x times secant squared x y so now what we&amp;#39;re going to do is um we&amp;#39;re going to take this term which doesn&amp;#39;t have a d y d x and we&amp;#39;re going to move it to this side so x d y d x secant squared x y is equal to negative y secant squared x y you know i realize there&amp;#39;s probably an easy way of doing this which i&amp;#39;m going to show you after this part let&amp;#39;s divide both sides by x secant squared notice that the secant squared cancel and in the end dydx is basically negative y over x so but let me show you the other way we can have done this so we had secant squared x y times i believe it was y plus x d y d x is equal to zero what we could have done at this point is just add this right here divide both sides by secant square so these cancel and you get y plus x d y d x is equal to zero zero divided by anything is zero and yeah it&amp;#39;s going to be much easier solving it like this so now let&amp;#39;s move y to the other side and then let&amp;#39;s divide both sides by x so therefore d y d x is equal to negative y over x so there&amp;#39;s more than one way of solving a problem let&amp;#39;s try another one let&amp;#39;s say if 36 is equal to the square root of x squared plus y squared how would you find the answer for this one now you can go ahead and take the derivative at this point but personally i believe it&amp;#39;s much easier if you simplify it or adjust it let&amp;#39;s square both sides we really don&amp;#39;t need to find out what 36 squared is we&amp;#39;re just going to write it as 36 squared because when we take the derivative it&amp;#39;s still going to be a constant and it&amp;#39;s going to become zero however this part is very useful when u square square root the radical disappears and it makes it a lot easier to find the derivative so now let&amp;#39;s differentiate both sides with respect to x the derivative of 36 squared which we already said was a constant is zero the derivative of x squared is two x and for y squared it&amp;#39;s two y times d y over d x so let&amp;#39;s move the two x to this side it&amp;#39;s gonna become negative two x and then let&amp;#39;s divide both sides by 2y so the twos cancel so therefore d y over dx is thus equal to negative x over y at least for this particular example and let&amp;#39;s say though we have to find the second derivative so we have this equation d y d x is equal to negative x over y whenever you want to find the second derivative and since we have a fraction we need to use the quotient rule which is v u prime minus u v prime over v squared u is basically the top part which is negative x u prime actually let me change the color so u is negative x u prime is the derivative of negative x which is negative one v is the bottom part which is y and v prime is the derivative of y which is one times d y d x so let&amp;#39;s use the formula so d squared y over dx squared the second derivative is equal to v which is y times u prime which is negative one minus u which is negative x times v prime which is just d y over dx okay so and v squared is simply y squared notice that we have a d y d x here what we need to do is take this term and plug it in for d y d x so we have negative y plus x times negative x over y times y squared now we&amp;#39;re going to do is multiply top and bottom by y just to get rid of this mini fraction so negative y times y let&amp;#39;s see if i can fit that here negative y squared and the y&amp;#39;s cancel here so we get negative x squared over whatever you do to the top you have to do to the bottom so you got to multiply top and bottom by y so over y cubed that&amp;#39;s the second derivative for this function that&amp;#39;s how you could find it so that&amp;#39;s it for this video hopefully this gave you a more or better insight on how to find the derivative using implicit differentiation',
// 	'in this video we&amp;#39;re going to focus on integrating polynomial functions and just some basic functions in general so what is the anti-derivative of 3x minus x to the fourth go ahead and try this problem now we could use the power rule the anti-derivative of x to the n is going to be x raised to the n plus one divided by n plus one plus c so this is three x to the first power and if you want to you could separate it into two separate integrals you don&amp;#39;t have to do this but you could do it if you want to so the antiderivative of x is x squared divided by two but multiplied by three and for x to the fourth it&amp;#39;s going to be x to the fifth over five plus some constant c and so that&amp;#39;s it for the first example and let&amp;#39;s try some other problems so go ahead and determine the antiderivative of 6x squared plus the square root of x now the first thing i would recommend doing is rewriting the expression the square root of x is x to the one half now let&amp;#39;s use the power rule so first let&amp;#39;s determine the antiderivative of x squared it&amp;#39;s x cubed divided by three and four x to the one half one half plus one is one point five or three over two and instead of dividing it by three over two you can multiply by two over three one divided by three over two is the same as two over three now we can simplify six divided by three is two so the final answer is two x cubed times two thirds x raised to the three halves plus c and so that&amp;#39;s it for this problem now let&amp;#39;s find the indefinite integral of this expression x plus 5 times 2x minus 3. so what do you think we need to do for this problem well we can&amp;#39;t use like a product rule for integration if you see a problem like this it&amp;#39;s best to foil before you integrate so x times 2x that&amp;#39;s going to be 2x squared and then x times negative 3 we have negative 3x and then 5 times 2x is 10x and then 5 times negative 3 is negative 15. and now let&amp;#39;s combine like terms so negative 3x plus 10x that&amp;#39;s going to be 7 x so this is what we now have so now we can find the anti-derivative the anti-derivative of 2x squared is 2x to the third power divided by 3 and for x to the first power it&amp;#39;s going to be x squared over 2 and if you find the anti-derivative of any constant it&amp;#39;s always going to be just add an x in front of it so the anti-derivative of negative 15 is negative 15 x and then plus c and that&amp;#39;s it for this problem try this problem go ahead and find the antiderivative of three x plus four squared now you don&amp;#39;t want to integrate it in this form instead you want to foil three x plus four so this is equivalent to three x plus four times another three x plus four so 3x times 3x that&amp;#39;s 9x squared and then we have 3x times 4 which is 12x and 4 times 3x that&amp;#39;s also 12x and then 4 times 4 which is 16. now let&amp;#39;s combine like terms 12 plus 12 is twenty four so we now have nine x squared plus twenty four x plus sixteen so now we can find the anti-derivative so for x squared it&amp;#39;s going to be x cubed over 3 and 4 x to the first power is going to become x squared over 2 and the antiderivative of a constant like 16 is just 16x and don&amp;#39;t forget to add c the constant of integration now let&amp;#39;s simplify what we have so the final answer is going to be 9 divided by 3 which is 3 24 divided by 2 is 12 plus 16x plus c and so this is the answer now what if you&amp;#39;re given a fraction for instance let&amp;#39;s say if we have x to the fifth power plus 4x cubed minus 5x all divided by x squared how can we integrate this particular function now the first thing you should do is divide every term in the numerator by x squared this works if this is a monomial if there&amp;#39;s only one term in the denominator and so you want to separate it into three fractions and then you want to integrate the expression so x to the fifth divided by x squared 5 minus 2 is 3 so that becomes x cubed and then 4x cubed divided by x squared that&amp;#39;s 4x and then 5x over x squared x squared you can see it as x times x so you can cancel the next variable and so you&amp;#39;re left with 5 over x with the negative sign as well now before we integrate because we have a rational function we need to rewrite the expression so let&amp;#39;s move the x variable to the top so it&amp;#39;s going to change from x to the positive one to x raised to the negative one so we have x cubed plus four x to the first power minus five x raised to the negative one power actually you know what we don&amp;#39;t need to do that i take that back i&amp;#39;m gonna leave it as one over x the reason for this is because the anti-derivative of one over x is the natural log of x and that&amp;#39;s something that you should keep in mind so the anti-derivative of x cubed is going to be x to the fourth over four and for four x is going to be four x squared over two and then minus five times the natural log of x plus c so we can write the final answer as one-fourth x to the four four divided by two is two and this is it minus 5 ln x plus c now let&amp;#39;s work on finding the indefinite integral of trigonometric functions what is the antiderivative of 1 plus tangent squared x dx so go ahead and take a minute and try that problem now this is one of the pythagorean identities that you need to be familiar with 1 plus tangent squared is equal to something and that something is secant squared now what is the antiderivative of secant squared the derivative of which trigonometric function is secant squared the antiderivative of secant squared is tangent so the answer is going to be tangent x plus c and so that&amp;#39;s it for this problem let&amp;#39;s try another one find the antiderivative of sine x divided by one minus sine squared go ahead and try that now you need to be familiar with another pythagorean identity and that is sine squared plus cosine squared is equal to one so if we take this term and move it to that side we can see that cosine squared is equal to 1 minus sine squared so we can rewrite this expression as sine divided by cosine squared so how does this help us what can we do with this what we need to do at this point is expand cosine squared cosine squared is basically cosine times cosine so i&amp;#39;m going to write this as sine x over cosine x times 1 over cosine x now what is sine divided by cosine sine divided by cosine is tangent and one over cosine is secant the derivative of what function is secant tangent the derivative of secant is secant tangent so the antiderivative of secant tangent is secant so the final answer is secant plus c so you need to review the trigonometric

// 	'in this video we&amp;#39;re going to talk about how to evaluate definite integrals now before we begin take a minute to hit that subscribe button and don&amp;#39;t forget to turn on the notification bell so let&amp;#39;s talk about the difference between a definite integral and an indefinite integral a definite integral has a lower limit of integration in this case a and b the upper limit of integration an indefinite integral does not have that so this is an indefinite integral and this here is a definite integral the antiderivative of a function f of x is capital f to evaluate the definite integral once you find the antiderivative you need to plug in the limits of integration and so the the value of the definite integral is going to be f of b minus f of a but let me show you the process by which we can evaluate a definite integral so let&amp;#39;s start with this example we need to find the antiderivative of each term in this expression what is the antiderivative of 8x cubed well let me give you a review first the antiderivative of a variable raised to a constant is going to equal that variable raised to the constant plus 1 divided by n plus 1. now for indefinite integrals we would have the constant of integration c but when dealing with definite integrals you don&amp;#39;t need to worry about c so as an example let&amp;#39;s say if we want to find the anti-derivative of x to the fifth all we need to do is add one to the exponent it&amp;#39;s going to be x to the sixth and then divide by that result so let&amp;#39;s say if we want to determine the antiderivative of 4 x to the 7th so we have a constant times x to the 7th first rewrite the constant and then find the antiderivative of x to the seventh so add one to seven that&amp;#39;s eight and then divide by that number and after that you can reduce it so eight is four times two we can cancel the four and so the answer is going to be x to the eight over two so that&amp;#39;s how you could find the antiderivative of monomials now let&amp;#39;s continue on with this example so to find the anti-derivative of 8x cubed first we&amp;#39;re going to rewrite the constant eight then we&amp;#39;re going to add one to the exponent three plus one is four and then we&amp;#39;re going to divide by 4. now let&amp;#39;s repeat this process for the next one so the antiderivative of 3x squared is going to be the constant 3 times x raised to the third power divided by three now what about the anti-derivative of six times x if you don&amp;#39;t see a number it&amp;#39;s always a one this is six times x to the first power so just like before we&amp;#39;re going to rewrite the constant 6 and then the variable add 1 to the exponent 1 plus 1 is 2 and then divide by that result now as was mentioned before because we&amp;#39;re dealing with a definite integral we don&amp;#39;t need to write the constant c here but we do need to write our limits of integration so now let&amp;#39;s simplify this expression 8 divided by four is two so we have two times x to the fourth three divided by three is one so that cancels so we have one x cubed which we can write as just x cubed six divided by two is three so then this is going to be plus three x squared evaluated from two to three now this is going to equal f of three minus f of two and keep in mind this expression here represents lowercase f of x and this expression is the antiderivative which represents capital f of x so we&amp;#39;re going to plug in 3 and 2 into capital f of x so in this in these brackets we&amp;#39;re going to put f of 3 and here this is going to be f of 2. so let&amp;#39;s plug in 3 into this expression so it&amp;#39;s going to be 2 times 3 raised to the fourth power plus 3 raised to the third power plus 3 times 3 squared now let&amp;#39;s substitute x with two in the second set of brackets so we have two times two to the fourth power plus two to the third plus 3 times 2 squared so this is f of 3 and this here is f of 2. so at this point we just need to do the math three to the fourth power is eighty-one and eighty-one times two is one sixty-two three to the third is twenty-seven three squared is nine times three that&amp;#39;s twenty-seven as well two to the fourth power if you multiply four twos you&amp;#39;re going to get sixteen and sixteen times two is thirty two two to the third power is eight two squared is four times three that&amp;#39;s twelve 27 plus 27 we no longer need the brackets anymore 27 plus 27 is 54. 32 plus 8 is 40 and 40 plus 12 is 52 so this is minus 52 54 minus 52 is 2 162 plus 2 is 164. so this is the value of the definite integral now this value here 164 represents the area under the curve that is between the curve represented by that function and the x-axis between the x-values 2 and 3. so that&amp;#39;s what the definite integral can do it can help you calculate the area under the curve but that&amp;#39;s the topic for another discussion for those of you who want more examples on evaluating definite integrals check out the description section of this video i&amp;#39;m going to post some links there if you wish to find more examples even harder examples including square roots and other stuff so feel free to take a look at that and if you haven&amp;#39;t done so already don&amp;#39;t forget to subscribe to this

// 	'- [Instructor] We have already covered the notion of area betweena curve and the x-axis using a definite integral. We are now going to then extend this to think about the area between curves. So let&amp;#39;s say we care about the region from x equals a to x equals b between y equals f of xand y is equal to g of x. So that would be this area right over here. So based on what you already know about definite integrals, how would you actuallytry to calculate this? Well one natural thing that you might say is well look, if I were to take the integral from a to b of f of x dx, that would give me the entire area below f of x and above the x-axis. And then if I were to subtract from that this area right over here, which is equal to that&amp;#39;s the definite integral from a to b of g of x dx. Well then I would net outwith the original area that I cared about. I would net out with thisarea right over here. And that indeed would be the case. And we know from ourintegration properties that we can rewrite this as the integral from a to b of, let me put some parentheses here, of f of x minus g of x, minus g of x dx. And now I&amp;#39;ll make a claim to you, and we&amp;#39;ll build a littlebit more intuition for this as we go through this video, but over an integral from a to b where f of x is greater than g of x, like this interval right over here, this is always going to be the case, that the area between the curves is going to be the integral for the x-interval that wecare about, from a to b, of f of x minus g of x. So I know what you&amp;#39;re thinking, you&amp;#39;re like okay well thatworked when both of them were above the x-axis, but what about the case when f of x is above the x-axis and g of x is below the x-axis? So for example, let&amp;#39;s say that we were tothink about this interval right over here. Let&amp;#39;s say this is the point c, and that&amp;#39;s x equals c, this is x equals d right over here. So what if we wanted to calculate this area that I am shading in right over here? You might say well doesthis actually work? Well let&amp;#39;s think about now what the integral, let&amp;#39;s think about what the integral from c to d of f of x dx represents. Well that would representthis area right over here. And what would the integral from c to d of g of x dx represent? Well you might say it is this area right over here, but remember, over this interval g ofx is below the x-axis. So this would give you a negative value. But if you wanted this total area, what you could do is take this blue area, which is positive, and then subtract this negative area, and so then you would getthe entire positive area. Well this just amounted to, this is equivalent to the integral from c to d of f of x, of f of x minus g of x again, minus g of x. Let me make it clear, we&amp;#39;vegot parentheses there, and then we have our dx. So once again, even over this interval when one of, when f of x was above the x-axis and g of x was below the x-axis, we it still boiled down to the same thing. Well let&amp;#39;s take another scenario. Let&amp;#39;s take the scenario when they are both below the x-axis. Let&amp;#39;s say that we wanted to go from x equals, well I won&amp;#39;tuse e since that is a loaded letter in mathematics,and so is f and g. Well let&amp;#39;s just say wellI&amp;#39;m kinda of running out of letters now. Let&amp;#39;s say that I am gonna go from I don&amp;#39;t know, let&amp;#39;s just call this m, and let&amp;#39;s call this n right over here. Well n is getting, let&amp;#39;sput n right over here. So what I care about is this area, the area once again below f. We&amp;#39;re assuming that we&amp;#39;relooking at intervals where f is greater than g, so below f and greater than g. Will it still amount to this with now the endpoints being m and n? Well let&amp;#39;s think about it a little bit. If we were to evaluate that integral from m to n of, I&amp;#39;ll just put my dx here, of f of x minus, minus g of x, we already know fromour integral properties, this is going to be equal to the integral from m to n of f of x dx minus the integral from m to n of g of x dx. Now let&amp;#39;s think about whateach of these represent. So this yellow integral right over here, that would give this the negative of this area. So that would give a negative value here. But the magnitude of it,the absolute value of it, would be this area right over there. Now what would just the integral, not even thinking aboutthe negative sign here, what would the integral of this g of x of this blue integral give? Well that would give this the negative of this entire area. But now we&amp;#39;re gonna takethe negative of that, and so this part right over here, this entire part includingthis negative sign, would give us, would give us this entire area, the entire area. This would actually give a positive value because we&amp;#39;re taking thenegative of a negative. But if with the area that we care about right over here, the area thatwe cared about originally, we would want to subtractout this yellow area. Well this right over here, this yellow integral from, the definite integralfrom m to n of f of x dx, that&amp;#39;s exactly that. That is the negative of that yellow area. So if you add the blue area, and so the negative of anegative is gonna be positive, and then this is going to be the negative of the yellow area, you would net out once again to the area that we think about. So in every case we saw, if we&amp;#39;re talking about an interval where f of x is greater than g of x, the area between the curves is just the definiteintegral over that interval of f of x minus g of x dx.',
